In this scenario, we will be installing Clair scanner.

Furthermore, we will be using [clair-scanner](https://github.com/arminc/clair-scanner) to pass image layers through Clair API and scanning them.

To scan locally or on the server, we will be using [clair-local-scan](https://github.com/arminc/clair-local-scan).
